# 01 Console Basics

Open your JavaScript Console in Google Chrome and enter the following examples. If your console becomes too cluttered with commands or errors, remember you can type `clear()` for a fresh start.

Type in the command as it is next to the number, then go through the modifications below.

You may want to write down your findings during this exploration for future reference.

If a solution or answer to a question eludes you, ask!

1. `console.log("Hello");`

    Use `console.log()` to print a different message.

    Use `console.log()` to print a different message -- one which includes a possessive (i.e. Erin's cats).

    Use `console.log()` to print the message you just typed, but enclose it with single quotes instead of double quotes. What happens?

    Let's fix this. Print the same message (again using single quotes), but place a slash (`\`) before the apostrophe in the message. What happens?

2. `document.write("Hello");`

    Use `document.write()` to print a different message.

    Use `document.write()` to print a different message, one which requires a slash (i.e. Hack\Slash).

    Use `console.log()` to print the message you just typed, but enclose it with single quotes instead of double quotes. What happens?

    Hint: Read up on [escape notation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String))

    When you fix the statement from the last step, try creating output to the document using a new line and tab!

3. `window.alert("Hello")`

    Type `window.confirm("Do you like JavaScript?")`. How is this different from `alert`? What value(s) does it return to the console?

    Type `window.prompt("What is your favorite programming language?")`. How is this different from `alert` and `prompt`? What value(s) does it return to the console?

    It is worth noting `alert`, `confirm` and `prompt` are not part of JavaScript, rather they are part of the Window Object model. We'll get into these later in class, but for now, you can see these are rudimentary ways to ask a user for input. (Eventually we will ask users to input data through forms on a web page.)

4. Write a few arithmetic problems. Use addition (`+`), subtraction (`-`), multiplication (`*`), division (`/`) and modulo (`%`). Like in Algebra, computers follow  'order of operation.' If you want to have part of a calculation performed before another, group the statement using parentheses (`( )`).

5. `Math.sqrt(25)`

   Type `Math.PI`.

   Type `Math.abs(-5)`. What the 'abs' method do?

   Type `Math.round(4.56)` What does the 'round' method do?

   (Try `Math.round(Math.PI)`. As long as we feed Math methods numbers or representation of numbers, they should work!)

   Type `Math.random()`. Type it again. And again. One more time! :) What do you notice about the numbers generated by 'random'?

   Enough Math! >:P But this is good to know because sometimes we need the Math in our programs!

6. `"Hello".toUpperCase()`

   Do you think a `toLowerCase()` method exists? Try it! How about `.capitalize`? :}

7. `"cat".replace("t", "r")`

   Type `"sass".replace("s", "b")`. What is the result?

   Type `"   Hello   ".trim()`. What does 'trim' do?

   Type `"Hello, world!".length`. (There is no `()` at the end.) What does `length` do?
