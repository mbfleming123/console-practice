# FizzBuzz!

**FizzBuzz** is a popular challenge given during programming interviews.

The rules are as follows: A script starts counting up from 1. When it reaches a number divisible by 3, instead of printing "3", it prints "Fizz". When it reaches a number divisible by 5, instead of printing "5", it prints "Buzz". When it reaches a number divisible by both 3 and 5, it prints "FizzBuzz".

Write a FizzBuzz script for the numbers 1-100.
