# Programming Exercises

Choose one of the following problems to solve.

Write out each step necessary to make the program work in plain English. Then code the solution, using your checklist as a guide. (Consider trying to do the same for the other exercises outside of class for practice.)

## Word frequency finder

  Given a string of words, count each time a given word is used. Print a histogram (chart) showing each word's usage.

  Example input: "cat cat dog fish cat bear alligator alligator badger badger badger cat"

  Example output:

  ```
  cat:       ****
  badger:    ***
  alligator: **
  bear:      *
  dog:       *
  fish:      *
  ```

## Lotto picker

  Create a script which pulls a set of five unique numbers and one unique number for the Powerball.

  Example output:

  ```
  Your lucky numbers are: 48, 12, 4, 15, 22.
  PowerBall: 33.
  ```

## Guess the number game.

  Randomly generate a number (i.e. 1-10). Prompt the user to guess. Continue the game until the user guesses correctly.

  Enhancements:
  - Extend the range of possible numbers to 1-100.
  - Tell the user whether they are 'hot' or 'cold' based on how far away they are from the number.
  - Count the number of guesses and return a response based on that number.
  - Keep track of numbers which have been guessed and mock the user when they guess the number a second time.
